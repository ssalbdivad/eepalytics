/**
 * The one definition of "what is true" during a live game.

 * Pure and browser-safe on purpose. It is rendered into the prompt the live coach is given, it is
 * served to the page by `GET /api/live/ground-truth`, and `scripts/eval-live.ts` reconstructs it
 * from stored timelines to score prompt changes. Three consumers, one shape — a second copy is a
 * copy that drifts, and the whole point of this block is that the model can trust it.
 *
 * It used to live in `review/live-vision.ts` beside the periodic-glance coach. That coach was
 * measured against the realtime one and deleted; this outlived it because it was never really
 * about the glance at all.

/**
 * Ground truth for the frame, read from the Live Client Data API.
 *
 * Named `VisionState` rather than `LiveState`: `analysis/live-coach.ts` already owns that name
 * for a different thing (the overlay's own view of the game).
 *
 * This exists because the coach hallucinated without it. Asked to comment on a downscaled JPEG of
 * a 1080p screen, it named a champion who was not in the game four times in seven minutes, called
 * a TEAMMATE a threat, and contradicted itself about Baron three times. Champion portraits in the
 * HUD are about thirty pixels wide at that scale; the model was guessing, and a guess delivered
 * in a warm voice sounds exactly like a read.
 *
 * The fix is not a better model or a bigger image. The League client already serves every one of
 * those facts locally, in about 30ms — who is in the game, which side they are on, who is dead,
 * what the score is. So the picture is used for *where things are*, and this is used for *what is
 * true*. That is the same rule the rest of the app already follows: never derive a fact you can
 * simply be told.

### Background — he can already see every line of this

Saying one of these out loud is the single most useless thing you can do here: he hears a fact he
is looking at while you spend the interruption. They are here for two other jobs — to decide WHICH
line above to say and how to phrase it (do not send someone on 20% health to take a camp), and so
that a timer you were not given is never invented.

They are written in the third person because they are NOT a script. If the sentence you were about
to say is one of these, the answer is PASS.
